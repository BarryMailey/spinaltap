                    <p>Harry Shearer, Michael McKean, and Christopher Guest will perform after the film’s screening in a one-night-only concert at the 18th annual Tribeca Film Festival.  The trio will play themselves in tribute to Spinal Tap.  Which means they won’t be taking on the personas of Derek Smalls, David St. Hubbins, and Nigel Tufnel.
                    After the performance, director Rob Reiner will join them on stage for a Q&A session from fans.
                    The rock mockumentary debuted in 1984 and followed the fictional band Spinal Tap on tour across America.  The last time the trio performed as Spinal Tap was in 2009, so this should be a treat for long-time fans of the fictional band.
                    Harry Shearer’s character Derek Smalls, who serves as the band’s bassist, released a solo album called Smalls Change (Meditations Upon Ageing) earlier this year. He also gave an in-character interview to TheWrap to accompany the release and gave a few updates on his fellow band members.
                    “Nig is out in the countryside in Hertfordshire — I think he’s renting it,” he explained. “He got deeply involved in animal husbandry and breeding miniature goats. He’s got his hands full — at least with baby goats. David, I hear from him, but I don’t use the internet because I suffer from addiction– so I use the post — and I will get something from him every once in a while with anticipation, mixed with fear, since he sends it using Chinese pictograms.”</p>

                <p id="news2Intro">(Reuters) - A U.S. judge said the creators of “This Is Spinal Tap” may pursue the fraud claim underlying their $400 million lawsuit against Vivendi SA over the 1984 cult film.</p>
                <a href="#" id="news2" class="readMore">Read more &raquo;</a>
                <div id="news2Story" class="newsStory">
                    <p>The decision on Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles is a victory for Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, Rob Reiner and Harry Shearer, who accused Vivendi of depriving them of a “fair return” from the film, its music and related merchandise.
                        Gee said the plaintiffs could try to show that Vivendi’s StudioCanal unit breached a 1982 agreement to finance and produce the film through self-dealing, failing to provide required accounting statements, nonpayment of royalties, and “nefarious accounting” to hide profits.
                        “This alleged misconduct amounts to more than mere false assurances that defendants were complying with the 1982 Agreement,” Gee wrote.
                        Vivendi, through spokeswoman Solange Maulini, declined to comment on Wednesday. The Paris-based company has controlled “Spinal Tap” rights for nearly three decades.
                        “This Is Spinal Tap” is a pioneering example of the mock documentary, and is part of the U.S. National Film Registry.
                        Its scenes include the band getting lost backstage before a concert; the deaths of drummers by spontaneous combustion, a bizarre gardening accident and other hazards; and amplifiers that “go to 11” rather than the normal maximum volume of 10.
                        According to the complaint, Vivendi had estimated that the plaintiffs’ share of “Spinal Tap” income was just $81 from merchandising between 1984 and 2016, and $98 from music sales between 1989 and 2016.
                        Shearer, who played bassist Derek Smalls, had sued for $125 million in October 2016. His Spinal Tap bandmates Guest and McKean and the film’s director Reiner joined the lawsuit four months later.
                        “We are entitled to ownership and control over our film, music, and the Spinal Tap brand,” Shearer said in a statement on Wednesday. “We look forward to finally getting our day in court, at a trial, with the evidence that to date Vivendi has tried to hide from us.”
                        Attorney says Weinstein will be "exonerated"Gee also dismissed a fraud claim against Vivendi’s Universal Music Group unit, finding a lack of intent to commit fraud through the alleged underreporting of music-related profits.
                        She said the plaintiffs could pursue a copyright claim to reclaim music rights.
                        Gee gave the plaintiffs 21 days to amend their complaint to address the UMG claims. Shearer said they plan to do so.
                        The case is Century of Progress Productions et al v Vivendi SA et al, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 16-07733.</p>

                    <p>Harry Shearer, aka Spinal Tap bassist Derek Smalls, has announced he’ll release his debut solo album later this year.
                        It’s titled Smalls Change (Meditations Upon Ageing) and will launch on April 13 via Twanky Records/BMG.
                        His Spinal Tap bandmates David St. Hubbins and Nigel Tufnel won’t appear on the record, but it does feature a star-studded lineup of guest musicians.
                        Those include guitar virtuosos Joe Satriani and Steve Vai, Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins, Red Hot Chili Peppers sticksman Chad Smith, Rick Wakeman, Toto’s Steve Lukather, Steely Dan’s Donald Fagen, Dweezil Zappa and Peter Framtpon.
                        To mark the announcement, Smalls has release a video for the title track and announced that he’ll tour in support of the album, with only one date confirmed so far: April 14 at the Saenger Theater, New Orleans.</p>

                <p id="news4Intro">Spinal Tap bassist Harry Smalls has spoken about going solo from the spoof metal band and their missed opportunity at collecting royalties from Metallica.</p>
                <a href="#" id="news4" class="readMore">Read more &raquo;</a>
                <div id="news4Story" class="newsStory">
                    <p>In an interview with Consequence of Sound, Smalls – portrayed by The Simpsons‘ Harry Shearer –responds to a question about getting a cut from the profits of Metallica’s best-selling ‘Black Album’. With tongue-firmly-in-cheek, he replies: “Well, if we owned a trademark on the color black, we sure should. I don’t think we thought of that.
                    “I don’t think it even occurred to us that (A) anybody else would do it, or (B) you could trademark a color.”
                    ‘Black Album’ has sold more than 100 million records worldwide since its release in 1991. 
                    Shearer portrayed Spinal Tap bassist Derek Smalls in the classic 1984 rockumentary This Is Spinal Tap.  
                    In character as Smalls, he also revealed that it was his allegiance to Tap that stopped him from joining Metallica, explaining “they wanted a commitment, and I thought I might do it for a bit, like a did with Lambsblood, the Christian rock band. But my heart was with Tap.
                    “It was always, “If Tap calls, I’m gone.” And they said, “You’re right, you’re gone.”
                    Nine embarrassing Spinal Tap moments that happened in real life
                    Smalls has since gone solo and in April released his debut concept album on growing old. The solo album ‘Smalls Change (Meditations Upon Ageing)’ features some very high profile collaborations, including members of Red Hot Chili Peppers and Foo Fighters.
                    Acclaimed musicians David Crosby, Steely Dan’s Donald Fagen, Peter Frampton, former Yes member Rick Wakeman, Dweezil Zappa, Joe Satriana and Steve Vai also appear.
                    Spinal Tap never let fiction get in the way of the music and played a headline show at London’s Wembley Arena and the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury in 2009.
                    Spinal Tap star Christopher Guest recalled the experience: “We played the Pyramid Stage in 2009. It was a fantastic show. There were 130,000 people there or something. Since the film 30 years ago we’ve gone on tour, playing Wembley, the Albert Hall, Carnegie Hall… It’s weird but great. The fiction became real.”</p>

                <h2 id="news5Title">Spinal Tap relaunch Fairness Rocks as creator rights campaign platform</h2>
                <p id="news5Intro">To coincide with tomorrow’s World Intellectual Property Day (not long to make the finishing touches to your street party preparations!), Spinal Tap have relaunched their ‘Fairness Rocks’ website as a campaign aimed at benefitting all creators.</p>
                <a href="#" id="news5" class="readMore">Read more &raquo;</a>
                <div id="news5Story" class="newsStory">
                    <p>The website was originally set up to promote a 2016 lawsuit brought by the fictional band’s Harry Shearer against entertainment conglom Vivendi, its film business StudioCanal and (subsequently) its music company Universal Music. Now also involving Shearer’s creative collaborators Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Rob Reiner, the lawsuit claims that the plaintiffs have not been paid royalties they are due on the film ‘This Is Spinal Tap’ and its soundtrack album.
                    It always seemed as if the ‘Fairness Rocks’ website was intended to foster some sort of creator rights movement. Now it is explicitly stating that to be the case. Leading the campaign, intellectual property rights expert Amanda Harcourt explains: “The ‘Fairness Rocks’ campaign was born out of the Spinal Tap creators’ knowing that they were not singled out for special treatment. In fact, only a select few highly successful creators actually receive a fair share of the benefits arising from the exploitation of their work”.
                    “Fans and audiences may not realise the economic truth behind the music and film industries”, she continues. “If consumers are repelled by t-shirts manufactured by exploited labour in the developing world, it struck us that, when informed of the commercial realities, audiences may similarly disapprove of the lack of fair treatment the talent receives at the hands of corporations exploiting their music and films”.
                    “To make matters worse, the practices of powerful tech companies have devastated the incomes of writers, composers, performers, and filmmakers right across the world”, she adds.
                    “The truth is that both power and financial imbalances, between the talent and corporations, have persisted for too long”, she goes on. “Individually, the talent has a weak bargaining position; often creators are required to sign contracts that fly in the face of the fundamental principles of laws designed to protect them”.
                    Explaining the aim of the campaign, she says: “At Fairness Rocks it is our intention to shine a light on some of these unfair practices, to help educate the public, and to inform young creators beginning their careers in music and film. We want to highlight the work of the talent advocacy organisations and to be a place where useful, up-to-date information can be found for media, moviemaker and musician alike”.
                    “Most importantly, we hope that filmmakers, songwriters, musicians and actors of all stripes will join Fairness Rocks and help us give them a unified voice. We want to provide a platform for the talent to speak openly and share their experiences of their industries. Put simply, all the talent should be receiving a fair share of the fruits of their work”.
                    “Sunlight is a great disinfectant”, she concludes. “So if the transparency of the Fairness Rocks campaign can help change some deeply-entrenched industry norms, the creative industry’s future will look a little bit brighter”.</p>

                <p id="news6Intro">Although Spinal Tap is one of the most well-known mockumentaries ever made - and effectively birthed the genre in the process - its creators allegedly haven't seen one red cent from the film.</p>
                <a href="#" id="news6" class="readMore">Read more &raquo;</a>
                <div id="news6Story" class="newsStory">
                    <p>Harry Shearer filed a lawsuit for $125 million against Vivendi in which he claimed that he had so far received just under $200 from merchandising and soundtrack sales for the film. He wasn't the only one who got screwed over by Hollywood accounting, either.
                    Today, Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Rob Reiner joined Shearer's lawsuit and upped the figure to $400 million. According to the lawsuit, the original deal was that the creators would receive 40% of the net profits from the film. However, through Hollywood accounting, it's meant that Vivendi has managed to keep the film in a loss throughout that time.
                    In Reiner's statement, the director claimed that what makes the case so egregious "is the prolonged and deliberate concealment of profit and the purposeful manipulation of revenue allocation between various Vivendi subsidiaries."
                    Vivendi has yet to release a statement.</p>
